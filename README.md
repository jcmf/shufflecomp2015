# Jacques's Guide to ShuffleComp 2015

This is meant to be a short online quiz thing to help encourage
people to play more games in [ShuffleComp: Disc
Two](http://ifwiki.org/index.php/ShuffleComp:_Disc_2), which is a
sort of game jam thing going on as I write this.  I'm kinda rushing
to slap this together into a usable state before the judging period
ends.

Note that I entered a game in the competition, and helped test a
few of the entries, and suggested songs that inspired other entries,
so there is the potential for the appearance of a conflict of
interest here.
