        # Jacques's Guide to ShuffleComp 2015

        Hi, my name is Jacques Frechet and this right here is a
        placeholder for the front page for this quiz thing.

        [start](#!)

        loading omg plz wait plz thx

        ## page not found, omg, what do we do, panic probably

        This is definitely a bug!  Unless you were intentionally
        monkeying with the URL bar or something, in which case it's
        probably your fault somehow so shame on you I guess?

        Anyway maybe try using your browser's back button or go
        back to the [beginning](#) or something, gosh, I don't know,
        don't look at me, it was never supposed to come to this,
        how did this even happen, omg, panic!

        Oh, wait, maybe some of the questions changed out from under
        you or something, and you're following an old link that is
        no longer valid?  That seems like a way that this could
        happen.  I guess that's not a bug?  I mean it seems kind
        of poor.  Probably you should assume it's a bug just to be
        safe.  Because assuming that things are bugs will increase
        your safety somehow I guess.  Safety is important!  Be safe!
