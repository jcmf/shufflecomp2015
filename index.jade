        version #{package.version} &mdash; [quiz][] &mdash; [random][]

        Hi there!

        So, I recently entered [a game][] in [ShuffleComp 2015][],
        which is sort of a [game jam][] type contest thing for
        [interactive fiction][] inspired by songs contributed by
        other entrants, and now I'm playing all the games, and wow,
        they're really good.  You should definitely try [all
        seventeen][games] of them!

        If that sounds daunting, fear not: I have made this here
        guide thing that could be just the thing to help you get
        started.

        Simply [answer a few questions][quiz] to get slightly
        randomized suggestions about which games you might like.
        You can bail out at any time and see a list based on the
        questions you've answered so far.

        Note that your answers affect the results in ways that
        depend on my opinions, and I am totally biased, so watch
        out!  You may instead prefer to request a [completely
        unbiased][random] but somewhat less personalized list.

        The choice is yours!

        Love,

        Jacques

        P.S. If you have questions or suggestions or comments or complaints
        please feel free to email me at <zaphod@toastball.net>.

        loading omg plz wait plz thx

        ## page not found, omg, what do we do, panic probably

        This is definitely a bug!  Unless you were intentionally
        monkeying with the URL bar or something, in which case it's
        probably your fault somehow so shame on you I guess?

        Anyway maybe try using your browser's [back](#back) button
        or go back to the [beginning](#) or something, gosh, I don't
        know, don't look at me, it was never supposed to come to
        this, how did this even happen, omg, panic!

        Oh, wait, maybe the code for this page changed out from
        under you or something, and you're following an old link
        that is no longer valid?  That seems like a way that this
        could happen.  I guess that's not a bug?  I mean it seems
        kind of poor.  Probably you should assume it's a bug just
        to be safe.  Because assuming that things are bugs will
        increase your safety somehow I guess.  Safety is important!
        Be safe!

        In the interest of full disclosure, the <span
        class="disclosure-control">\*</span> indicates games I
        wrote or helped test or songs I suggested, all of which
        are things that might bias me, so I want to make sure
        that's all out in the open.
        <span class='disclosure-shown'>(If the <span
        class="disclosure-control">\*</span>s bother you, click
        one to hide them.)</span><span class='disclosure-hidden'

        class="disclosure-control">\*</span>s to show them
        again.)</span>
